# neo4j-social-media-graph
This repo contains some of my experimentation with the Neo4j graph database.
- the generate_graph.py file will generate an example of a social network, with 3 different communinites
- There are other cypher query files that analyze this data, including finding n-cliques, and identifying connected components with both pure cypher & the Graph Data Science (GDS) library
